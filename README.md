# PassVault
Password remembrance application.

This project is under developpement.

The application will use a database of encrypted passwords, which will then make a request to the server to acquire the key. Once this is completed, the application receives the encrypted password and the key; it then processes the password and destroyes the key. The key is always kept in the server, so if you lose your phone, you're ok.

Application being developped by : Alexandre Boyer and Alexandre SÃ©guin.
